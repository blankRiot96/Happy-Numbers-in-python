# Happy-Numbers-in-python
I tried to make a program that prints happy numbers in python, and also identifies the first 8 happy numbers 

## More info
I basically wanted to practise using git and github, so i decided to work on some python with a repository in git.
I got the project idea from - https://github.com/karan/Projects
There are some awesome project ideas there for all languages, and this one seemed more like the ones i was used to
Im also currently learning Tkinter in python, so after im confident in my skills with tkinter ill once again come back to git and github
and i guess post another repo with a tkinter project.
I just finished learning the basics of pygame, so i will come back to git to make that as well

I never actually understood the point of posting repo's in github to be honest ;-;
Im doing it just to get familiar with git and github, and to revise python once more.
But i don't know why anyone would post solo project, because i guess github is all about working with others right?
Well i AM new so i hope i understand later
